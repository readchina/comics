# READCHINA: lianhuanhua

## Chinese Comics in Translation

For most of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, pocket size comic books (*lianhuanhua* 连环画, often literally translated as "linked images") were an integral part of Chinese everyday reading culture, providing readers with entertainment, information and/or political instruction. Established as such throughout the 1920s and 1930s, after 1949 these comic books continued to range from adaptations of literary texts or films to hagiographies of socialist heroes like Lei Feng to stories propagating the usefulness of using fertilizer in agricultural production. Published as handy pocket-sized booklets, they were shared among children and adult readers alike to be read at street stall libraries or at work units after hours. *Lianhuanhua* production was massive, with an estimated 50.000 titles published since the founding of the PRC. Moreover, one in three books published in 1986 was a comic!

*Lianhuanhua* were indeed quite popular reading material. To provide contemporary readers and researchers with a glimpse into the vast Chinese comic culture, the READCHINA project publishes a number of exemplary comics from the Mao and early post-Mao years with English translations on this webpage. We hope that these translations will spur further interest and research into this diverse, relevant and, very often, entertaining medium.

During the Mao years, Beijing Foreign Languages Publishing House published translations of comics into various foreign languages. In addition, the 1970s saw a few translations published outside China (most notably a translation into Italian published by Gino Nebiolo et al and retranslated into English and German; and a translation of excerpts of *lianhuanhua* into German prepared by Wolfgang Bauer). Today, more *lianhuanhua* in translation can be found online, such as:

- Zhuang Guanyu's *Manhua Journey to the West*: [https://www.nickstember.com/manhua-journey-west-part-1-6/](https://www.nickstember.com/manhua-journey-west-part-1-6/)
