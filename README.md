# Comics

This repo contains the webpage for translation and source images of the lianhuanhua comics.

## Requirements

- [Hugo (extended)](https://gohugo.io)
- [pandoc](https://pandoc.org)

## Installation

These steps are only required once, to install the requirements on your local machine:

```bash
brew install pandoc hugo
```

## Getting the Sources

Before you can get local copy of the webpage up and running on your machine you need to clone this repo. The [hugo-book theme](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book) is installed as a submodule.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules --remote-submodules https://github.com/readchina/comics.git
```

If you forgot to include the submodule flags when cloning the repo run the following:

```
git submodule update --init
```

within the submodule we are on the `feature/prev-next` branch

## Building

To Build a local dev version run:

```bash
hugo server -D  
```

(`-D` will also build drafts)

You should see something like this:

```bash

## Contents

As always avoid spaces in file or folder names: ~~`zhu fu/zhu fu Version 2022.md`~~ -> `zhufu/zhufu.md`. You must stick with the project layout of this repo. Contents go into `content/docs/` folder. Create a new folder when adding a comic. 

```bash
mkdir content/docs/new-comic
```

### Text

Start by saving the word file in the folder you just created. Then use pandoc to convert the original document into markdown.

```bash
pandoc -s content/docs/new-comic/*.docx --wrap=none  -t markdown -o new-comic/new-comic.md 
```

Each comic needs to be inside a top level folder using the translated title for the comic (no spaces), e.g. `the-watch/_index.md`.
Each file is then split into:
- `_index.md` (contains the introduction)
- `A-translation-notes.md`
  - `B-cover.md`
  - `B-front.md`
  - `B-page-XX.md`
- `C-references.md`

The basic template for a translation page is

```md
---
title: Panel XX
---

![biao front](./../../images/biao/seifert0726_biao_00ZZ_0XX.jpg)

{{< columns >}}

<!-- source -->

<--->

<!-- translation -->

{{< /columns >}}
```

Use regex to create the proper markup inside the full `newcomic.md` file.

To create empty template files:

```bash
touch B-page-{01..78}.md     
```

Then copy each page/panel into the new file. 


### Images

Images go inside a folder with the comic name inside `static/images`:

```bash
static
└── images
    ├── biao
    │   ├── seifert0726_biao_0001_0.jpg
    │   ├── seifert0726_biao_0003_0.jpg
    │   ├── …
    └── niqiu
        ├── seifert0397_nqkg_0001_0.jpg
        ├── seifert0397_nqkg_0003_0.jpg
        ├── …
```

To include images in your markdown use:

```md
 ![biao cover](./../../../images/biao/seifert0726_biao_0001_0.jpg)
```

## Deployment

Deployments is fully automated on GitHub Actions. In cases where you need to debug the build, run:

```bash
hugo 
```

This will create a `public/` folder containing the compiled webpage. You should delete this folder after debugging as Hugo will not remove its contents before subsequent builds.
